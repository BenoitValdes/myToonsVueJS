# Webtoon RSS Reader (WIP)

A personal project built with **Vue.js** to read webtoons from RSS feeds that use only images in their content. The goal of this app is to provide a **single platform to read webtoons**, no matter the source, as long as the feed follows standard RSS guidelines.

This project is also a **learning experience in front-end development**, and everything has been created from scratch by me, from the **UI to the backend**.

## Features

- Supports image-only RSS feeds (perfect for webtoons and comics).
- Unified interface to read content from multiple sources.
- Responsive design for a smooth reading experience.
- WIP: Features are still being developed and improved.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** Vue.js  
- **Backend:** Custom implementation to fetch and serve RSS feeds  
- **Other:** Standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
